# Books-LLm
The intention for this repo is to showcase my web mining skills as well as my ability to implement LLMs that will use the scraped data.

As of the moment of this update the project will consist of:
- HTML scraper (Data extraction complete, processing left)
- Browser Scraper (Data extraction complete, processing left)
- LLM implementation on the scraped data (Yet to start)

## Project description
The end goal for this project is to simulate a book selling shop. The source used for the data is https://books.toscrape.com/ which is a website intended to be scraped and contains proxy data.
The idea is to collect all the data and then have the LLM do the selling of books as well as answer questions and give out suggestion about the books based on the information gathered.
